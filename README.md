# Here are some implementation of my datastructure and algorithm I understand properly

## Go [here](snippets) to see useful snippets.

I use the `template.cpp` as a template for all the competetive programmings. The `Data Structure Implementation` folder is quite old, and I do not use it much (Though I am planning to update and make a documentation for it soon). 

Please have a look at [code snippets](snippets) which I always use during competetive programming to copy paste into my template file.
