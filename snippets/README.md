# Most used code snippets for competetive programming.

Here all the code snippets have self explanatory comments in the top of the files. I will add more snippets time to time when I need. The snippets are grouped below so you can find what you want quickly.

## How I use

I use Visual Studio Code for all sorts of coding and project development. 

For competetive programming, there is an extension names ICIE. Go through its documentation, install it, in settings, point the `library` to this `snippets` folder. This snippet files are formatted (with `///` comments) to work with the extension.
